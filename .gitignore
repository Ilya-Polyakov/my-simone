It's good, thanks. But how to ignore some directories, such as target, out, production?

I think .dll files are important if you're developing with .NET.

Also, you could include .ai, .eps, and .psd on it.

Thanks, for the great snippet.

@arulrajnet @cptstarling it is not recommended to ignore entire .idea directory. Instead we should add only the two lines below to local .gitignore file:

/.idea/workspace.xml
/.idea/tasks.xml

This way all good project configuration (for example Code Style, namespaces mapping, etc) will be shared among all team.

*.log isn't working for me. I have the logs 'server.log', 'connected.log', and 'visitorcount.log' in a folder named 'logs', and GitHub Desktop keeps asking me to commit the files whenever they are modified.

I'm using Notepad to add these updates and have rebooted GitHub Desktop. Is there any weird technical feature that I am missing?

Here's a more robust version of the vim ignores for your global .gitignore:

**/*~
**/*.bak
**/*.sw[abcdefghijklmnop]
